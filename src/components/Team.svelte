My typing journey started around the new year of 2020 during Covid year of school, and the following Summer afterwards was when I joined the wordPractice server and began my journey with the bot. I am currently a very busy employed highschool student taking rigorous courses, but when I have time after studying I enjoy coding, typing, and sometimes simply doing nothing but exist because life gets hectic and tiring and I need time to reboot.",
