When I first began working on it, I was still learning how to code, so the initial version was very basic. However, as my coding skills improved, so did the bot, becoming what it is today. Outside of coding, like playing table tennis, rowing and sleeping in my free time.",

I am currently a very busy employed highschool student taking rigorous courses, but when I have time after studying I enjoy coding, typing, and sometimes simply doing nothing but exist because life gets hectic and tiring and I need time to reboot.",
